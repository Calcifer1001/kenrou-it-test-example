# Kenrou IT - Testing example

This is dedicated for the Kenrou IT students so they can learn a little bit more about testing

In this repo, we make unit tests with jest and we make one test with puppeteer.

To initialize this, you'll need to clone the repo and run

```
npm i
```

To run the example website you need to run:

```
npm start
```

And if you want to test, run:

```
npm test
```
